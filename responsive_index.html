        “I encountered the first edition of Scott Meyers’ Effective C++ as a struggling programmer
        in the trenches, trying to get better at what I was doing. What a lifesaver! I found
        Meyers’ advice was practical, useful, and effective, fulfilling the promise of the title
        100 percent. The third edition brings the practical realities of using C++ in serious
        development projects right up to date, adding chapters on the language’s very latest
        issues and features. I was delighted to still find myself learning something interesting
        and new from the latest edition of a book I already thought I knew well.”
