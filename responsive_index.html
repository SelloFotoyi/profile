        <h2 class="subTitle">Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            I've built this profile website to showcase and provide a reference point for my skill set.
            My emphasis is on self-learned skills (these are particularly web front-end as well as an enhancement
            of my pre-existing coding skills), but please do refer to my resume (link above) for more details
            on what I can do. I've attached my contact details at the end of the page.
            I'd be glad to hear from you!

        <h2 class="subTitle" id="skills">My Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I was introduced to coding during the earlier years of my qualification through
            a Software Development course, which mainly focused on Object Orientated Programming with C++. I broadened
            my programming skill set through self-learning of web front-end fundamentals and exploration of other
            programming languages. I have categorised my skills below (these <i><strong>will</strong></i> increase in
            number or be improved as I am continually working on my skill set).

            “I encountered the first edition of Scott Meyers’ Effective C++ as a struggling programmer
            in the trenches, trying to get better at what I was doing. What a lifesaver! I found
            Meyers’ advice was practical, useful, and effective, fulfilling the promise of the title
            100 percent. The third edition brings the practical realities of using C++ in serious
            development projects right up to date, adding chapters on the language’s very latest
            issues and features. I was delighted to still find myself learning something interesting
            and new from the latest edition of a book I already thought I knew well.”
