            “I encountered the first edition of Scott Meyers’ Effective C++ as a struggling programmer
            in the trenches, trying to get better at what I was doing. What a lifesaver! I found
            Meyers’ advice was practical, useful, and effective, fulfilling the promise of the title
            100 percent. The third edition brings the practical realities of using C++ in serious
            development projects right up to date, adding chapters on the language’s very latest
            issues and features. I was delighted to still find myself learning something interesting
            and new from the latest edition of a book I already thought I knew well.”
